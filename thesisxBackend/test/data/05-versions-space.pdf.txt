Rare or orphan diseases affect only small populations, thereby limiting the economic incentive for the 
drug development process, often resulting in a lack of progress towards treatment. Drug repositioning 
is a promising approach in these cases, due to its low cost. In this approach, one attempts to identify 
new purposes for existing drugs that have already been developed and approved for use. By applying 
the process of drug repositioning to identify novel treatments for rare diseases, we can overcome 
the lack of economic incentives and make concrete progress towards new therapies. Adrenocortical 
Carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with no practical and definitive therapeutic approach. We apply 
Heter-LP, a new method of drug repositioning, to suggest novel therapeutic avenues for ACC. Our 
analysis identifies innovative putative drug-disease, drug-target, and disease-target relationships for 
ACC, which include Cosyntropin (drug) and DHCR7, IGF1R, MC1R, MAP3K3, TOP2A (protein targets). 
When results are analyzed using all available information, a number of novel predicted associations 
related to ACC appear to be valid according to current knowledge. We expect the predicted relations will 
be useful for drug repositioning in ACC since the resulting ranked lists of drugs and protein targets can 
be used to expedite the necessary clinical processes.
A rare (or orphan) disease afflicts only a small percentage of a population. It is not possible to specify a global 
number for this percentage, as it varies by year and by region
1
. Although the number of people with any given rare 
disease is small, due to the high number of these diseases, the number of people suffering from at least one rare 
disease is relatively high. As more than 7,000 rare diseases have been identified to date, they have affected more 
than 300 million people worldwide
2
.
Some believe that the first step in the development of a new drug for a disease is to examine repositioning an 
existing drug for that disease. Only if that stage is unsuccessful should one enter the more costly stages of tra-
ditional drug discovery
3
. Repositioning a drug is the use of a drug in the treatment of a disease for which it has 
not been designed or developed from the outset. This approach is efficient regarding speed and cost since many 
early stages of the design and production of drugs can be omitted; for example, the drug does not require specific 
evaluations in terms of safety, pharmacology, and toxicology. An additional benefit is that, in the final stages of 
production, there is no need to develop new infrastructure for manufacturing. In oncology, given the increased 
demand for new treatments, drug repositioning can be especially beneficial
4
.
The use of drug repositioning for rare diseases has recently attracted significant interest. Drug companies are 
often hesitant to apply costly traditional drug development processes to rare diseases for two reasons: 1) the lack 
of economic incentive due to the small number of people affected by each case, and 2) the lack of information and 
data about these diseases, their drugs, and corresponding drug targets. Therefore, the use of drug repositioning 
in the treatment of rare diseases is highly promising. In addition to pharmaceutical companies pursuing drug 
substitution for rare diseases, many government agencies and research institutions are using drug repositioning 
to pursue humanitarian goals such as improving the living conditions of patients with rare diseases
2
. Considering 
the small number of people with any particular rare disease, the study of the causes and ways of treating these 
diseases may represent a first step in the field of personalized medicine
3
.
There are some notable instances of successful drug repositioning related to rare diseases. For example, nico-
tinamide has been repositioned for the effective treatment of rare Friedreich’s ataxia (This example and others are 
discussed at http://www.findacure.org.uk/drug-repurposing-case-studies/). A complete list of repositioned drugs

(for rare and common diseases) are presented in the drug repositioning portal (http://www.drugrepurposingpor-
tal.com). The FDA also has provided a list of repositioned drugs for rare diseases in the Rare Disease Repurposing 
Database (RDRD) (http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions). Although 
most repurposing examples have been identified mostly by accident, they demonstrate the potential ability in 
this area. It is self-evident that bioinformatics methods to expedite drug repurposing should be considered and 
expanded.
Integration of information on diseases, drugs, and how they affect and function in the body, with other exist-
ing biological and therapeutic information, can contribute to the treatment of diseases, especially rare diseases. 
Bioinformatics methods can be useful in this regard, with the ability to identify and predict the potential relation-
ships that exist between diseases and drugs and the factors affecting them. Our research team has recently intro-
duced a computational approach to drug repositioning, called Heter-LP
5
. Heter-LP has been tested and evaluated 
in repositioning drugs for various diseases, yielding significant results
5
. Here, we examine the effects of Heter-LP 
in the field of drug repositioning in a rare disease named AdrenoCortical Carcinoma (ACC).
ACC is a rare disease for which few effective treatment options are available. The drugs used in the treatment 
of this disease are highly toxic, and new therapeutic options for ACC are urgently needed
6
.
What follows is a brief overview of ACC. Heter-LP is then briefly introduced. We then provided a description 
of the clinical and computational methods proposed for drug repositioning for ACC. The results are presented 
and evaluated in Section 2. In Section 3, the data necessary for the implementation of Heter-LP and our proposed 
method are introduced. Finally, in Section 4, we provide conclusions and recommendations for future work.
Adrenocortical carcinoma (Acc)
The adrenocortical glands are endocrine glands located at the top of each kidney. These glands produce various 
hormones, including adrenaline, and aldosterone and cortisol steroids. Each gland has an outer cortex and a med-
ullary portion (http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/). This gland has among the highest level of blood supply 
per gram of tissue, such that up to 60 small veins may enter each gland. The normal functioning of the adrenal 
gland may be impaired by conditions such as infection, tumor, genetic disorders, and autoimmune diseases, or by 
side effects of medication. These disorders impact health and cause discomfort either directly (such as through 
infections or autoimmune diseases), or through changes in hormone production (such as some types of Cushing’s 
syndrome) (http://www.wikipedia.org).
There are two types of dangerous abnormalities in the adrenal glands, ACC, which is related to the cortex, and 
malignant medullary pheochromocytoma. Both diseases are considered rare diseases
7
. We here focus on ACC. A 
detailed description of ACC is presented in the supplementary file, section 1.
In this paper, the purpose is not to investigate the diagnostic methods of ACC; we are focused on applying 
drug repositioning to identify novel treatment avenues for ACC. Interested readers are referred to
8
 for more 
information on diagnostic methods. Also, Crona et al.
9
 reviewed research on diagnosis approaches and improving 
clinical care of ACC.
The options for drugs to treat ACC are limited. Among the more widely used drugs is mitotane. In some cases, 
anti-hormonal drugs are also used. The extent and the effect of mitotane are not definitive. Overall, the efficacy 
of this drug is low, with 19–34% of cases resulting in a minor response; a complete response is seen only rarely. 
Proponents of mitotane suggest that even if the tumor size is not reduced, it can control abnormal hormone pro-
duction and eliminate some symptoms
10
. A brief overview of current therapeutic approaches for ACC, along with 
a summary of the benefits and disadvantages of each, is presented in the supplementary file, section 2.
Another therapeutic approach to different types of cancers is targeted therapy. In this therapeutic approach, 
one tries to find proteins that affect the disease in a particular way and then develop drugs that target these pro-
teins to enhance or modify their behavior. Recent studies on the molecular mechanisms of ACC tumor growth 
has suggested novel potential targets
11
. The most promising protein targets for ACC are “Insulin growth factor 
(IGF-1,2)”

,   “mTOR“
11,13
, “Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1)”

, “CTNNB1”

 described in the supplementary 
file, section 3.
Understanding of the molecular events and signaling pathways that may be disrupted in a disease, will signifi-
cantly contribute to improving a range of available diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment approaches. We describe 
some important molecular events and signaling pathways related to ACC in section 4 of the supplementary file.
Heter-Lp
Many real-world problems can be represented by graphs or networks, where items are represented as nodes and 
relations as edges between these nodes. The majority of graph-related research has focused on homogeneous net-
works, where all nodes and edges are of the same type. However, more complex problems require more detailed 
models which cannot be presented by simple homogeneous networks. Their corresponding networks comprise 
different kinds of nodes and edges; such networks are known as heterogeneous networks. Algorithms that operate 
on heterogeneous networks differ from those for homogeneous networks in many respects. One such algorithm 
is link prediction, where one predicts new relations (edges) between different items (nodes), based on previous 
known relations and attributes (like the weight of relations and some characteristics of nodes).
We modeled a solution to the drug repositioning problem as a link prediction problem over a heterogene-
ous network consisting of drugs, diseases, drug targets, and relations between all of them, named Heter-LP
5
. 
Heter-LP is a semi-supervised machine learning method, based on label propagation over a heterogeneous net-
work. Heter-LP consists of three main steps: data modeling, projection, and label propagation. In data modeling, 
the required data should be gathered and integrated into one heterogeneous network comprising three homo-
geneous sub-networks (drugs, diseases, and drug targets) and three heterogeneous sub-networks (drug-disease, 
drug-target, and disease-target). In the projection phase, the topological similarity of each pair of concepts 
is computed based on heterogeneous sub-networks (The purpose is to determine the similarity of two nodes

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
based on how they are related to other nodes). These topological similarities are integrated with homogeneous 
sub-networks, and, finally, our proposed label propagation algorithm is applied. This results in new predicted 
links between drugs, diseases, and targets.
Heter-LP is an iterative approach, and its convergence to a locally optimal solution is proven in
5
. This algo-
rithm could also be used for different proposes in various domains such as social networks, and any other prob-
lems need to be modeled by heterogeneous networks.
Related work
In this section, we first review clinical approaches for drug repositioning related to ACC. We then discuss compu-
tational techniques related to rare diseases. Lastly, we introduce some essential general computational methods 
for drug repositioning, including the widely used DT-Hybrid approach

.
Clinical drug repositioning approaches for ACC. Little research has examined the possibility of drug 
repositioning for treating ACC; furthermore, these few studies have employed only clinical and experimental 
approaches. The most important drugs discussed in such researches are: mebendazole (MBZ)

ouabain, methotrexate, pyrimethamine
17

, mitotane, etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin

. A detailed description is presented in the supple-
mentary file.
Despite the efforts of various organizations, such as the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors 
(ENSAT), in treating ACC and improving the livelihoods of these patients, the disease is still largely uncontrolla-
ble, and practical treatment strategies remain elusive

.
Computational drug repositioning approaches for rare diseases. Today, there is an ever-growing 
amount of biological data with the potential to benefit many application areas. The use of purely clinical and tra-
ditional drug repositioning methods are not able to scale and leverage these growing data. Accurate and efficient 
computational methods are required to fully utilize available data to present the most promising leads for con-
sideration by biological scientists and to extricate researchers from confusion due to a large amount of data. Over 
the years, different methods for computational drug repositioning and drug-target interaction prediction have 
been presented, of which only a small number have been explicitly applied to rare diseases. The most important 
methods are

General computational drug repositioning methods. It is not possible to review all available compu-
tational drug repositioning methods here in detail, due to their wide variety. We have categorized these methods 
and explored one of the most important categories, network-based methods, in our previous paper
22
. One of 
the best performance metrics for evaluating drug repositioning methods is the area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic (ROC) curve, or the AUC. A number of methods are able to achieve an AUC of greater than

 (sorted alphabetically). A brief description of each was presented 
in
22
. In the present study, our method Heter-LP is compared with DT-Hybrid, the leading contemporary method. 
DT-Hybrid is largely a recommendation method based on projection, where input data are modeled as a bipartite 
network (a bipartite network is a graph comprising two separate groups of nodes. Each edge connects one node 
from one group to a node of the other group, i.e. there is no edge between the nodes of the same group), and 
the similarity of each group of nodes is computed based on the similarity of other groups and across relations 
between two groups.
Results
The purpose of the method is to predict the relations that do not already exist in the input data. Novel predictions 
associated with ACC, resulting from Heter-LP, are presented in Table 1. The DT-Hybrid algorithm could not pre-
dict any novel drug-target and drug-disease relations. Its novel disease-target predictions are presented in Table 2. 
It should be noted that the predicted relations are weighted by a number in the [0, 1] interval, which is considered 
as the probability of the existence of the relation. Due to the distribution of weights with large differences between 
them, we used a threshold to select the more effective weights. We only have considered predicted relations with a 
weight greater than or equal with 0.005 here. A complete list of these predictions and their corresponding weights 
are available in the supplementary file, section 7.1. A detailed description is provided in the next subsections.

To validate each of the novel predicted relations, the three sub-sections below discuss supporting evidence for 
each type of novel predicted relationships from Tables 1 and 2. In addition, we discuss the association of these 
results with previously known signaling pathways of ACC in section 7.2 of the supplementary file.
Drug-target relations. Among the novel predicted relations by Heter-LP there are two drug-target inter-
actions. One is an interaction between hsa:1584 and Spironolactone, while the other is hsa:2230 as a target for 
Flavin adenine dinucleotide. The importance of these relations for ACC is that hsa:1584 and hsa:2230 are the only 
known targets for the only accepted drug for ACC (mitotane). The therapeutic effect of mitotane is caused by its 
influence on these targets, which is documented in DrugBank (http://drugbank.ca). It is notable that these drugs 
are predicted from among 11140 possible drugs (i.e. the total number of drugs in the input dataset).
We explore these predictions by analyzing data from DrugBank (DB) and SuperTarget. Through interactive 
searching using the DB online interface, we are able to access additional details that were not included in the 
downloaded data used as input data for the predictions in Table 1. For example, the interactive searching iden-
tified 15 different drugs associated with target hsa:1584, including Spironolactone. In the downloadable files 
provided by DB (which are used in input data) only mitotane and metyrapone are related to hsa:1584 (the dif-
ference in data available by download vs. interactive online searching may be related to certainty, where only 
highly specific relations are listed in the downloadable files). SuperTarget also contains several drugs for hsa:1584, 
including Spironolactone (Hydrochlorothiazide). This analysis serves to validate the novel predictions made here 
and indicate that Spironolactone could be a good candidate for a novel therapeutic approach to ACC.
The second predicted relation (hsa:2230 and Flavin adenine dinucleotide), does not appear to be discussed in 
the literature but could be a good candidate for subsequent experimental analysis as a novel ACC therapy.
Drug-disease relations. The only reported candidate for ACC in our input datasets is mitotane. In addi-
tion to mitotane, Heter-LP predicted one other drug candidate for adrenocortical carcinoma, cosyntropin. 
Cosyntropin is one part of the natural corticotropin hormone (ACTH). This hormone stimulates the adrenal 
cortex, which results in the production and secretion of adrenocortical hormones. In fact, cosyntropin produces 
cortisol and adrenaline by stimulating the adrenal glands and has traditionally only been used to diagnose and 
resolve adrenal gland problems (e.g., Addison’s disease, adrenal insufficiency caused by the use of steroids or from 
tumors).
On the other hand, mitotane, which is the first known therapeutic option for ACC patients, causes adrenal 
insufficiency and, due to its adverse effects on adrenocortical cells, often requires hydrocortisone replacement 
therapy (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). It is therefore hypothesized that cosyntropin can be used as an adjunct to 
mitotane to re-stimulate the adrenal glands. This promising prediction is achieved from among the 11140 differ-
ent possible drugs.
Disease-target relations. As explained in the introduction, targeted therapy is an effective therapeutic 
approach for treating various types of cancers. The principal goal is to find proteins that are critical to the disease 
process. In this way, one can target the proteins to return the status to reasonable conditions. Heter-LP can be 
used to predict novel targets for a given disease. We here examine the five novel gene and protein targets predicted 
by Heter-LP to be associated with ACC disease (see Table 1). These predictions are achieved from among 5568 
possible targets.
•	hsa:3480 (IGF-1R): As explained in the targeted therapy section, IGF-1R inhibitors are currently being con-
sidered for ACC. Although their use in the treatment of ACC is not yet widely adopted in clinical practice, it is 
an essential consideration in clinical trials. This relation is not explicitly included in the input data; the ability 
of Heter-LP to predict this relationship is notable.
•	hsa:7153 (TOP2A): Jain et al.
31
 examined the expression and function of Top2A in human adrenal gland 
diseases. Their main propose was to examine the anti-ACC properties of factors that target Top2A. It has 
been shown that the expression of this gene in ACC is much higher than normal and benign tumors, which, 
in turn, is higher than observed in normal tissue. They went on to examine TOP2A inhibitors and demon-
strate that TOP2A inhibitors show good anticancer activity against ACC. Finally, they conclude that TOP2A 
inhibitors are effective in controlling ACC metastasis and should be tested clinically. The fact that Heter-LP 
discovered this link as a novel predicted relation illustrates its ability to predict novel and viable hypotheses 
worthy of further investigation.
•	hsa:1717 (DHCR7): According to the ctdbase (http://ctdbase.org/detail.go;jsessionid= 646E5B51C39B-
893F65017843961E9D37?type=gene&acc=1717&view=disease), ACC is one of the diseases associated with 
hsa:1717. GenomeNet (http://www.genome.jp/db/pcidb/ kna_cpds/23747) also indicates that hsa:1717 is 
the reductase enzyme for “7-Dehydrocholesterol / Provitamin D3, Cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol”, a compound 
known to be associated with adrenal carcinoma. The relation between Adrenocortical carcinoma and DHCR7 
is also discussed in
32
. These resources, that were not used by Heter-LP in making this prediction, serve to 
reinforce our confidence in both Heter-LP and its novel predicted relationships.

•	hsa:4157 (MC1R): MRAP (Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein) is a protein that has a significant effect 
on the expression and function of MCR. In the adrenal gland, MRAP is an essential factor in the expression of 
MC2R / ACTH receptor functional expression. MC2R and MRAP are mainly involved in the adrenal cortex, 
and it has been proven that patients with cortisol deficiency have mutant lesions in MC2R and MRAP [11]. 
A previous study [11] describes the relationship between the MCR family, especially MC2R, with the adrenal 
glands and their function. Several studies have examined the role of MC1R in adrenal insufficiency [12, 13]. 
This novel prediction of Heter-LP is verified in this way.
•	hsa:4215 (MAP3K3): According to our studies, no direct relationship is reported between hsa:4215 and ACC. 
However, GeneCard (http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MAP3K3) mentions that one of 
the phenotypic series related to hsa:4215 is endocrine/exocrine gland phenotype group. ACC and its related 
phenotypes are members of this group. Therefore, this novel prediction is also plausible and warrants further 
investigation.
Based on these results, it can be concluded that Heter-LP has been successful in predicting plausible and 
interesting disease-target relationships. These predictions present novel testable hypotheses for subsequent inves-
tigation by researchers in the pharmaceutical and medical sciences.
Predicted relations by DT-Hybrid. As mentioned in Table 2, DT-Hybrid predicted only two novel targets 
associated with ACC: hsa:6409 (SEN2) and hsa:595 (CCND1); no other relations were predicted by DT-Hybrid 
for ACC and there is no overlap between the predictions of DT-Hybrid and Heter-LP. A literature search was 
conducted to verify the DT-Hybrid predictions. SEN2 could not be verified, and no published relation with ACC 
could be identified. However, CCND1 has been suggested as a molecular marker of cell cycles that may regulate 
gene expression related to ACC
33,34
.
As a second attempt to validate the DT-Hybrid predictions, we first searched for Adrenocortical Carcinoma 
in the disease section of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes -http://www.kegg.jp), producing 
known associated drugs, pathways and related genes. This search resulted in the following known AAC-related 
targets: ACTH-R (deletion) [HSA:4158], GNAI2 (mutation) [HSA:2771], N-ras (mutation) [HSA:4893], 
IGF II (overexpression) [HSA:3481], p53 (LOH, mutation) [HSA:7157], p16/INK4A (LOH, low expression) 
[HSA:1028], and MEN1 (LOH, mutation) [HSA:4221]. Note that there are established relationships between 
some of these known AAC targets and those predicted by Heter-LP, as discussed in section 2.3 and in section 8.2 
of the supplementary file. However, there is no relation between these genes, and the two DT-Hybrid predicted 
targets. Therefore, we tried to investigate these predicted targets by searching KEGG for the genes SEN2 and 
CCND1. SEN2 had no results, while CCND1 is only known to be associated with non-AAC cancers such as oral 
cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, and laryngeal cancer.
Materials and methods
Data preparation. Here, as mentioned before, the heterogeneous network consists of three sub-networks, 
drugs, diseases, and targets. Six separate matrices are required: (1) drug similarities, (2) disease similarities, 
(3) target similarities, (4) drug-disease relations, (5) disease-target relations, and (6) drug-disease relations. 
Leveraging several data sources, we gathered data for each element of the Heter-LP model and organized them as 
a comprehensive dataset that is available through GitHub (https://github.com/dkrlab) and the DKR site (http://
dkr.iut.ac.ir/projects) (a detailed description of this dataset is also presented with it). In total, we gathered a col-
lection comprising 11140 drugs, 11494 diseases, and 5568 targets. A brief description of using data in addition to 
previously known relationships involving ACC is also available in the supplementary file.
Methods. After gathering the necessary datasets described in Section 3 and the construction of our network 
model, Heter-LP was run to discover drug-target, drug-disease, and disease-target links relating to adrenocortical 
carcinoma. Pseudocode and the workflow of Heter-LP is presented in detail in our previous paper [7] and is also 
included with the Heter-LP source code in GitHub and the DKR website (within the same project as the datasets 
mentioned in Section 3.1).
To provide the opportunity to compare the results of Heter-LP with other drug repositioning methods, we also 
apply DT-Hybrid to our input data. It is necessary to mention that DT-Hybrid can only be run on a justified data 
set, such that item names in different sub-networks are all consistent. For example, drugs listed in the drug-drug 
subnetwork should be shared with drugs listed in the two other sub-networks related to drugs (drug-disease and 
drug-target); likewise for targets and diseases. Therefore, we had to find a common list for each item and cus-
tomize the input dataset such that DT-Hybrid is only applicable to 313 common diseases, 1403 common drugs, 
and 738 targets. A detailed explanation of prediction results for both Heter-LP and DT-Hybrid is presented in 
the next section.
conclusions
While the pharmaceutical industry has explored the use of drug repositioning in the field of rare diseases, this 
work has been hampered by a lack of a fundamental and systematic approach. Fortunately, in recent years, the 
necessity of extending the bioinformatics methods in this area has been recognized. In this regard, our team 
has proposed a hybrid computational approach based on the integration of biological networks for drug reposi-
tioning. We have here demonstrated the utility of Heter-LP, our method of label propagation in heterogeneous 
networks, to discover new drug repositioning leads for Adrenocortical carcinoma. In the first stage, we collected 
and compiled the necessary data for the diseases and genes concerned, the drugs, and their targets. These data 
were used in the second stage to predict novel drug-disease, disease-target, and drug-target relationships about 
ACC, a rare disease. The plausibility of several predicted links was supported by literature and datasets not used

in the actual prediction of the links. It is necessary to mention that not one of the available computational drug 
repositioning methods has demonstrated such success as Heter-LP in suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for 
rare diseases.
In drug development, one of the critical points is the study of the interactions of a drug with its targets to 
determine the therapeutic effect of that drug on various diseases. On the other hand, in new treatments (especially 
the treatment of various types of cancers), the relationship between a disease and key proteins within the disease 
process has become more prominent, and this targeted therapy approach has shown good promise. Therefore, in 
addition to the use of well-known therapeutic drug-disease relationships, we have also used drug-target interac-
tions and disease-protein/gene relationships to provide a list of potential candidates for repositioned drugs for 
ACC. According to the results and studies carried out, Heter-LP has been able to provide appropriate predictions 
for all three types of relationships. In some cases, there is a substantial supporting data to confirm these rela-
tionships and, although these relationships have not been recorded in the latest available datasets, they are being 
pursued by medical researchers with some entering the final evaluation process. These examples serve to validate 
the application of Heter-LP to drug repositioning for rare diseases.
